									<h1>About Sean "DasSkippy" Frederico<br />
									</h1>
									<p>I am a male American Computer Game Design Student studying at University of California Santa Cruz</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_3006.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I was born and raised in Encinitas California in November 2002. I have always loved video games and storytelling since I was a child. I have created several projects on Unity and Minecraft that have been played by over 25,000 players. I am very familiar with C and C# coding, as well as blender and unity. Creating games and telling stories is my passion and I'd love to coninue to build a career out of it.</p>
								<p>Having the opportunity to watch uploaded videos of players playing and enjoying my games has been such an amazing experience. Seeing all these players explore a game that I created has helped inspire me and instill in me that being a game designer is something I want to pursue.</p>
